Edu Sign is a free, offline-friendly mobile app that translates real-time speech into text and sign language GIFs, designed to support students with hearing impairments in classrooms. Built using MIT App Inventor, it offers a lightweight and user-friendly interface that makes communication more inclusive. With a focus on ethical AI in education, Edu Sign respects privacy, uses no cloud storage, and functions without an internet connection â€” making it accessible to all, especially in low-resource environments.
